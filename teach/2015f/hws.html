<!--Each project should be done in a team of two. It is possible to do a single-person project with prior approval.
The clock for the projects start on Nov 2, 2010.
Each team should send a one-paragraph proposal on the selected project for approval. The proposal must contain clearly the problem description, the intended outcome, and the key theoretical and/or experimental components.
All projects must contain experimental results on at least 3 datasets. Prior approval is needed for any exceptions (please have a very good reason for an exception). Each dataset should contain at least 100K points.
Evaluation will be based on three things: Project presentation, a final report, and the novelty of ideas, observations and results.
