<ul>
<li>Machine Learning is concerned with computer programs that automatically improve their performance through experience. This 3-credit course covers introductory topics about the theory and practical algorithms for machine learning from a variety of perspectives. Topics include supervised learning, unsupervised learning and learning theory.
</li> 

<!--<li>Assignments include a student project, --> 
<li>Assignments include multiple short programming and writing assignments for hands-on experiments of various learning algorithms, multiple in-class quizzes, an in-class mid-term and an in-class final exam.
</li>

<p> <b>Course Grading Policy</b> </font> 

<p>   The grade will be calculated as follows: </p> 

<ul>
     <li>Assignments (60%, with six assignments)</li>
     <li>Midterm (20%) </li>
     <li>Final (20%) </li>
     <li> <del>Quizzes (5%)  </del></li>
</ul>


<font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="+1"> <b>Additional Non-Linear Constraint</b>
</font>
<ul>
     <li>   In order to pass the course, the average of your midterm and final
must also be "pass". </li>
</ul>


<font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="+1"> <b>Assignment due dates, Lateness
and Extensions</b> </font>  

<!---<p><b><i>All communication regarding late assignment submission
should be done directly with the TAs, not with the instructor.</i></b>
<p> -->

<ul>
     <li> Unless otherwise specified, assignments should be submitted through collab and are due  <b>
     at 11:59pm on the due date</b> .  </li>
    
  <li>Programming solutions should be placed in each student's appropriate
   Collab  directory. 
    </li>
    <li> <del> Multiple in-class quizzes will be given over the whole semester. Please do not miss classes in order to take these pop quizzes.  </del></li>

   <li>Each student has <b>three</b> extension days to be used at his or
her own discretion throughout the entire course. Your grades would be
discounted by 15% per day when you use these 3 late days.
You could use the 3 days in whatever combination you like. For example,
all 3 days on 1 assignment (for a maximum grade of 55%) or 1 each day
over 3 assignments (for a maximum grade of 85% on each).
After you've used all 3 days, you cannot get credit
for anything turned in late. </li>
