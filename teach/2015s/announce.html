<ul>
     <li>45% for the participation and in-class paper presentations/discussions (we have 30 classes till April 29th);</li>
     <li>50% for the quality of the class project delivered by each team;</li>
    <li>5% for a few in-class quizzes in this course. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
 <li><b>Sit-in: No.  This course is for registered students only. </b></li>

<p>  <b>Course Seminar</b> </p>
<ul>
     <li> On every Tuesday, the whole class will meet @ Rice Hall;</li>
     <li>Instructor will provide a lecture about the relevant topic for the first half of the class;</li>
    <li>The whole class will discuss the readings (assigned in the previous week)  during the second half of the class;
     </li>
     <li>Each student is expected to prepare a slide with (at least) 3 pages 
     summarizing each assigned reading. 
     <li>Each week, we will assign 2 to 3 reading materials (video lectures or papers or research lecture slides )</li>
     <li>Template of the summary: 
     <ul>
     <li> 1. Motivations / Why needed ? / Why important ? 
2. Previous solutions 
3. Key insights
4. Key equations
5. Key conclusions
       </ul>
     </li>
     <li> Students are picked up randomly to present their slides of the reading</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p><b>Course Project</b> </p>
<ul>
     <li> On every Thursday, each team takes turns to meet the instructor for 30mins @ Rice Hall 503 (see agenda on collab);</li>
     <li>Each team is required to report their progress formally on the project (weekly summary + plan of action for next week);</li>
    <li> I expect each team will generate a formal publication to a relevant top-tier conference by the end of the semester.; </li>
    <li> Each project should be done in a team of 1 to 3 students.  </li>
    <li>Each student's class project  carries 50% weight in grading and is expected to span about 15 weeks.</li>
</ul>


<p>   General timeline about the project: </p>

<ul>
<li> Week3: Submission of project proposal ;</li>
<li> Week10: Submission of project mid-phase report;</li>
<li> Week15: Submission of presentation slides;  </li>
<li> Week16 (Tu - 0428): Project presentation. Each presentation will be 10-minutes long with 2 minutes for questions.</li>
<li> Week16 (Sat) : Submission of final report. Each report is expected to be at least 9 page long. A latex template will be provided. </li>
</ul>

<!--Each project should be done in a team of two. It is possible to do a single-person project with prior approval.
The clock for the projects start on Nov 2, 2010.
Each team should send a one-paragraph proposal on the selected project for approval. The proposal must contain clearly the problem description, the intended outcome, and the key theoretical and/or experimental components.
All projects must contain experimental results on at least 3 datasets. Prior approval is needed for any exceptions (please have a very good reason for an exception). Each dataset should contain at least 100K points.
Evaluation will be based on three things: Project presentation, a final report, and the novelty of ideas, observations and results.
