<p>  <font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="+1"> <b>Course Requirements and Grading</b>
</font>  </p>
<p>The grade will be calculated as follows: </p>

<ul>
     <li>Assignments (60%, with each assignment 10%)</li>
     <li>Midterm (20%) </li>
     <li>Final (20%) </li>
</ul>


<p>  <font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="+1"> <b>Difference Among 4501-001 and 6501-007</b>
</font>  </p>
<p>For homework-5, students in  </p>

<ul>
     <li>4501-001, will be required to finish a programming assignment ; </li>
     <li>6501-007, will be required to finish a course project; </li>
</ul>


<font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="+1"> <b>Additional Non-Linear Constraint</b>
</font>
<p>   In order to pass the course, the average of your midterm and final
must also be "pass". </p>
<p>  <font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="+1"> <b>Assignment due dates, Lateness
and Extensions</b> </font>  </p>

<p><b><i>All communication regarding late assignment submission
should be done directly with the TAs, not with the instructor.</i></b>
<p>


<p>Unless otherwise specified, assignments should be submitted through collab and are due at the <b>beginning of
class</b> on the due date.  Please do not miss class in order to finish
an assignment. <p>


<p>Each student has <b>three</b> extension days to be used at his or
her own discretion throughout the entire course. Your grades would be
discounted by 15% per day when you use these 3 late days.
You could use the 3 days in whatever combination you like. For example,
all 3 days on 1 assignment (for a maximum grade of 55%) or 1 each day
over 3 assignments (for a maximum grade of 85% on each).
After you've used all 3 days, you cannot get credit
for anything turned in late. <p>

<!--

<p>If you have a substantial reason for being late with an assignment
(e.g., going on a conference, got really sick, family emergency, etc)
then please email the TA in charge (not the professor), which is always
written at the top of an assignment, with advance notice and an explanation
of your situation.  The TA in charge will grant extensions that do
not count towards the four late ones if your reason is
legitimate and you asked for the extension in a timely manner.<p>

<p>Homework solutions automatically go online 7 days after the
assignment is due, so if you plan to take an extension longer than 7
days you need to make advance arrangements with the TA in charge.
</p> -->

<!--
<p> Unless otherwise specified, assignments are due at the <i> beginning </i>
of class on the specified date.  Please do not miss class in order to finish
an assignment, as it will be considered late anyway if you turn it in after
class started. <b>&nbsp;Update</b>: &nbsp;<i>Assignments are an additional
day late after 5:00 PM, starting the day after the assignment is due. &nbsp;Weekend
days count as late days!&nbsp;</i> &nbsp;For example, if an assignment is
due on Tuesday you have until 5 PM on Wednesday to be only 1 day late. </p>
<p> If you need an exension, you can have one automatically, without having
to ask for it, for up to a total of five days cumulatively over the entire
course.  If you used your five days and find yourself needing another extension,
email the instructor (not the TAs!) explaining your circumstances.  Extensions
that are requested promptly will be granted more liberally. </p>


<p>  </p>
<p> <font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="+1"> <b>Assignment Hand-in Procedure</b>
</font> </p>
<p> Assignment must always be turned in to the TA in charge, <i> not to the
instructor! </i> </p>

<p> If you are turning in your assignment late, you must contact the TA in
charge and deliver your assignment to him/her in person, or else make alternative
arrangements with him/her. &nbsp;If you need to get an assignment to your
TA and they are not available (such as during the weekend), you should type
your solutions (Latex or Word+Eqation Editor, etc) and email them to the
TA.&nbsp; Do not email a scanned copy of your hand-written HW, and <i>never</i>
leave your assignment on your TA's desk! </p>
<p> Never shove your assignment under the instructor's door or leave -- it
might be lost! </p>
<p>  <font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="+1"> <b>Collaboration among Students</b>
</font> </p>
<p>  The purpose of student collaboration is to facilitate learning, not
to circumvent it.  Studying the material in groups is strongly encouraged.
 It is also allowed to seek help from other students in understanding the
material needed to solve a particular homework problem, provided no written
notes are shared, or are taken at that time, and provided learning is facilitated,
not circumvented.  The actual solution must be done by each student alone,
and the student should be ready to reproduce their solution upon request.
 Any form of help or collaboration must be disclosed in full by all involved
on the first page of their assignment (e.g. "Jane explained to me what is
asked in Question 3.4", "I pointed Joe to section 2.3 since he didn't know
how to proceed with Question 2").  When such collaboration is deemed excessive
by the instructor, grading may be somewhat affected. However, collaboration
without full disclosure will be handled much more severely, in compliance
with <a
